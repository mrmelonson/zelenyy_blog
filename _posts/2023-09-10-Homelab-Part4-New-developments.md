My god it has been a minute. In my last blog post i mentioned the next time i would post i would have a NAS, well i didn't lie, but i also didn't expect it to take over a year to get one. As is tradition, below you can see my new network diagram, but wait... is that an AP? What the hell is DRAGON? is that a layer 3 switch???

Alot has changed since the last post, for one i got a job at Cisco Meraki who do cloud-managed business networking equipment and as such i managed to snag a few things for free. But before i talk about the networking stuff, lets talk servers!
