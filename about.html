    <div class="bio">
      <p>Heya, I'm Patrick, currently working as a network support engineer for Cisco Meraki. I assist all sorts of IT teams from all around the world and help them fix networks ranging from simple home networks to complex VPN hub-spoke topologies spanning multiple sites.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, I run and manage my own home-lab where I sharpen my skills as a networking professional and sysadmin. I manage a couple of servers running Windows server with DNS and RADIUS, a NAS with media players, automated backups and a virtual host running a handful of containers.</p>
      <p>Finally, I'm currently studying up to complete my CCNA and potentially move up to getting a CCNP or CWNA completed!</p>
