    <h1>About me</h1>

    <div class="bio">
      <p>Iâ€™m Patrick Fennell and I am a full-time university student studying at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).</p>     
      <p>I study computer science and am majoring in cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>I have a keen interest in security and network infrastructure, which I hope to convey through this blog.</p>
      <p><strike>Finally, I am also looking for an internship or a job, so if you are a recruiter please hire me!</strike></p>
      <p><b>UPDATE!</b><br>The kind people over at Cisco Meraki have hired me as a network support engineer intern! So I guess i'm doing that now!</p>
